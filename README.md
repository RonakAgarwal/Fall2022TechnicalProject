# Fall2022TechnicalProject
Technical Project for Shopify Data Science Intern Fall 2022 Application

On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 

### a. Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 

The thing that is wrong with this calculation is the existence of significant outliers in the data

b. What metric would you report for this dataset?
c. What is its value?
